# INST314-Project6
This data pertains to project 6 of INST314, Spring 2023 semester. A survey was conducted on a total of ten individuals of varying age, gender, and educational background. Each respondent was first given information on three competing definitions of feminism: difference-denying feminism (Q1), difference-removing feminism (Q2), and difference-honoring feminism (Q3). Based on this information, they were then asked to give a response of "agreement" to each definition of feminism on a scale of 1-10, with 1 being strongly disagree and 10 being strongly agree. Additionally, the respondents were asked which definition out of the given three has had the most cultural and political impact in the past few decades (note: impact does not always directly correlate with agreement). Finally, it was recorded whether or not each respondent was or had been a mother, their age at time of survey, and gender.
